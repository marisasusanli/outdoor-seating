# North Brooklyn Outdoor Seating Guide
A mobile app that maps out local restaurants and bars with outdoor seating. Tapping on any map pin will provide more info on that location, as well as a photo of what the outdoor seating area looks like. Users can add businesses on the map to their list of favorites.  

Created for the "Stackathon" hackathon during the Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy.
